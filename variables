Variables and Environment Variables in Linux
Overview
Variables in Linux are used to store data and configuration settings. They can be categorized by their scope (who can access them) and their lifetime (how long they persist).

Summary

1. Categorized by Scope & Lifetime
Type	Lifetime & Scope	How to Set	How to View	Purpose
Local Shell Variable	Temporary. Lasts only for the current shell session. Not inherited by child processes.	MY_VAR="value"	set | grep MY_VAR	Temporary data, loop counters, calculations within current shell session.
Environment Variable	Temporary. Lasts for current shell session and is inherited by all child processes.	export MY_VAR="value" or MY_VAR="value" then export MY_VAR	env | grep MY_VAR or printenv MY_VAR	Configure environment for shell and other programs.
"Permanent" User-level	Persistent across logins. Defined in user startup files.	Add export MY_VAR="value" to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile	Available in new shell sessions	Personal preferences and environment variables.
"Permanent" System-wide	Persistent for all users. Defined in system startup files.	Add export MY_VAR="value" to /etc/environment or /etc/profile.d/my_vars.sh	Available to all users	System-wide configuration settings.
2. Categorized by Function
Type	Description	Common Examples
Standard Environment Variables	Pre-defined by shell and system to configure environment.	USER, HOME, PWD, SHELL, LANG, TERM
Path Variables	Contain colon-separated lists of directories.	PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, MANPATH
Application Configuration	Control behavior of specific programs.	EDITOR, BROWSER, http_proxy, JAVA_HOME, PS1
Positional Parameters	Hold arguments passed to shell scripts (shell variables, not environment).	$0, $1, $2, $@
Special Shell Variables	Pre-defined shell variables for script control.	$$, $?, $#
3. Practical Demonstration
Temporary Variables (Last until shell is closed)
bash
# Create a local shell variable (not exported)
MY_TEMP_VAR="I will vanish when this shell closes"
echo $MY_TEMP_VAR

# Create an environment variable (exported, inherited by children)
export MY_TEMP_ENV_VAR="I will also vanish, but my children will know me"
echo $MY_TEMP_ENV_VAR

# Test inheritance in child process
bash
echo "Child sees: $MY_TEMP_ENV_VAR" # This will work
echo "Child sees: $MY_TEMP_VAR"     # This will be empty
exit # return to parent shell
"Permanent" Variables (Survive shell restarts)
For a User:

bash
# Edit user's bash configuration
nano ~/.bashrc

# Add to bottom of file:
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
export EDITOR="nano"

# Load changes into current shell
source ~/.bashrc
For the Whole System:

bash
# Create system-wide configuration (requires sudo)
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/jdk_home.sh

# Add content:
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
4. Managing Variables
Viewing Variables
All variables: set

Environment variables only: env or printenv

Specific variable: echo $VARIABLE_NAME (e.g., echo $HOME)

Removing Variables
bash
# Remove any variable (shell or environment)
unset MY_VAR
Common Environment Variables
USER: Current logged-in user

HOME: Path to user's home directory

PWD: Present working directory

PATH: Directories where shell looks for commands

SHELL: Path to current shell program

EDITOR: Default text editor

Define in startup file for persistence:
  - User: ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile
  - System: /etc/profile.d/, /etc/environment
Key Points
Shell variables are local to the current session

Environment variables are inherited by child processes

"Permanent" variables are automatically recreated from startup files

Use export to make variables available to child processes

Use startup files (~/.bashrc, /etc/profile.d/) for persistence
